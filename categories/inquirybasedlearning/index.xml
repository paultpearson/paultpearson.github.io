      <description>In a typical Calculus 2 class, sequences and series are learned near the end of the semester. In my Calculus 2 class in Spring 2020, we started with polynomial approximations on day 1 of class. Why?
 Polynomial approximations provide context for sequences and series.
 Polynomial approximations can be explored through graphs and spreadsheets, thereby giving meaning to the symbolic procedures used for their construction.
 Polynomial approximations give students a way to understand how the function keys on their calculators actually work.</description>
