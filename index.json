We calculate some of this Dieudonne ring for the nonnegatively graded spaces in the spectrum tmf, and show that it splits into two parts that occasionally overlap. One part comes from the mod 2 homology of the spectrum tmf, and the other part comes from the Hopf ring for the sphere. We also recompute the known Hopf rings and Dieudonne rings for the mod 2 and integral Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectra and the connective spectrum bo representing connective real K -theory. As with tmf, these are viewed as having two parts which come from the homology of the spectrum and the Hopf ring for the sphere.","tags":["Algebraic Topology","K-Theory","Dieudonne Rings","Hopf Rings"],"title":"The mod 2 homology of the connective spectrum of topological modular forms.","type":"publication"}]
