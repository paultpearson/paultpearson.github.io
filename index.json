The basic idea is to bound a function $f$ above and below by polynomials $q$ and $p$ over an interval, integrate $p(t) \\leq f(t) \\leq q(t)$ over $\\lbrack 0, x \\rbrack$, and (if possible) solve the resulting inequalities for $f(x)$. This method works well if some derivative (or integral) of $f$ is $f$ again, such as when $f(x)$ is $e^x$, $\\sin(x)$, $\\cos(x)$, $\\sinh(x)$, and $\\cosh(x)$.\n Show that if $f(x) \\leq g(x)$ for all $x$ in $\\lbrack a, b \\rbrack$, then $\\displaystyle \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx \\leq \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx$.\n Verify that $e^{-t} \\leq 1$ for all $t \\geq 0$. Then, integrate both sides of the inequality $e^{-t} \\leq 1$ over $\\lbrack 0, x \\rbrack$ and solve the resulting inequality for $e^{-x}$ to get a degree $1$ polynomial approximation to $e^{-x}$.\n  Johnson, Wells. \u0026ldquo;Power Series Without Taylor\u0026rsquo;s Theorem.\u0026rdquo; The American Mathematical Monthly 91.6 (1984): 367-369. https://doi.org/10.1080\u0026frasl;00029890.1984.11971434\n","date":1580774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580774400,"objectID":"ad0aebaa803a8e9e4e602bda2639ecb9","permalink":"https://paultpearson.github.io/post/polynomial-approximations-without-taylor-s-theorem/","publishdate":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/polynomial-approximations-without-taylor-s-theorem/","section":"post","summary":"In a typical Calculus 2 class, sequences and series are learned near the end of the semester.

These courses prevent many students from attaining their educational goals and often become graduation roadblocks. At the authors’ home institution, general chemistry has become a gatekeeper course in which approximately 25% of students do not pass. This failure rate in chemistry is common, and often higher, at many other institutions of higher education, and mathematical deficiencies are perceived to be a large contributing factor. This paper details the development of a highly accurate predictive system that identifies students at the beginning of the semester who are “at-risk” for earning a grade of C- or below in chemistry. The predictive accuracy of this system is maximized by using a genetically optimized neural network to analyze the results of a diagnostic algebra test designed for a specific population. Once at-risk students have been identified, they can be helped to improve their chances of success using techniques such as concurrent support courses, online tutorials, “just-in-time” instructional aides, study skills, motivational interviewing, and/or peer mentoring.","tags":["Diagnostic Algebra Test","Chemistry Placement","Neural Network"],"title":"A genetically optimized predictive system for success in general chemistry using a diagnostic algebra test","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   Paul Pearson - Curriculum Vitae --  Paul Pearson   pearsonp@hope.edu paultpearson.github.io      Education   Ph.D in Mathematics June 2006 Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois\nThesis: The mod p homology of topological modular forms\nAdvisor: Paul Goerss\n  BA in Mathematics May 2001 Saint Olaf College, Northfield, Minnesota\nHonors: Phi Beta Kappa, summa cum laude, departmental distinction\n     Work Experience   Associate Professor July 2018 - present Department of Mathematics, Hope College, Holland, Michigan\n  Assistant Professor July 2014 - June 2018 Department of Mathematics, Hope College, Holland, Michigan\n  Visiting Assistant Professor July 2012 - June 2014 Department of Mathematics, Hope College, Holland, Michigan\n  Visiting Assistant Professor August 2009 - May 2012 Department of Mathematics, Fort Lewis College, Durango, Colorado\n  Visiting Assistant Professor January 2007 - July 2009 Department of Mathematics, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York\n  Visiting Research Scholar September 2006 - November 2006 Mittag-Leffler Institute, Stockholm, Sweden\n  Instructor September 2005 - June 2006 Department of Mathematics, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois\n  Teaching Assistant September 2001 - June 2005 Department of Mathematics, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois\n     Publications  McMorris, D., Pearson, P., \u0026amp; Yurk, B.
