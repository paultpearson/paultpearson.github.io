We call this method the seaweed method and use it to identify different stages of bean beetle embryo maturation. We use randomized simulations to evaluate the seaweed method for accuracy and precision at different levels of noise. Our results support the efficacy of the seaweed method as a means for analyzing time-lapse photographs of bean beetle embryos and a wide variety of other time signals.","tags":["Wavelets","Bean Beetle Maturation"],"title":"A modified wavelet method for identifying transient features in time signals with applications to bean beetle maturation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Pearson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472702400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472702400,"objectID":"ff98f06c38651aa3ba835133cb255fe1","permalink":"https://paultpearson.github.io/publication/homology-kr/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/homology-kr/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper examines the mod 2 homology of the spaces in the Omega-spectrum for connective Morava $K$-theory, i.e., the mod 2 Hopf ring for connective Morava K-theory. A natural set of generators for this Hopf ring arising from the homology and homotopy of the connective Morava K-theory spectrum is calculated and the non-trivial circle product relations among the generators arising from homology and homotopy are determined. This Hopf ring calculation is accomplished using Dieudonné ring theory and Adams spectral sequences for the connective Morava K-theory of Brown–Gitler spectra.","tags":["Algebraic Topology","Morava K-Theory","Dieudonne Rings","Hopf Rings"],"title":"The mod 2 Hopf ring for connective Morava K-theory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Pearson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1390453200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1390453200,"objectID":"f899867a7458af63ae887d63feb4562f","permalink":"https://paultpearson.github.io/publication/homology-ko/","publishdate":"2014-01-23T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/homology-ko/","section":"publication","summary":"We calculate the connective real $K$-theory homology of the mod 2 Brown-Gitler spectra.

The low-dimensional cluster diagram makes the neural network's solution to the high-dimensional clustering problem easy to visualize, interpret, and understand. As a case study, a clustering problem froma diabetes study is solved using a neural network. The clusters in this neural network are visualized using the Mapper method during several stages of the iterative process used to construct the neural network. The neural network and Mapper clustering diagram results for the diabetes study are validated by comparison to principal component analysis.","tags":["Neural Network","Topological Data Analysis","Mapper"],"title":"Visualizing clusters in artificial neural networks using Morse theory","type":"publication"}]
